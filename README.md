# FAQ
How will I know this works? 
Check .txt logs for "Devfee" or "devfee" or any "eth_submitLogin" where your address isn't show. If you do have any make a clean install of claymore and extract all files in there.

Why isnt this open source?
Because claymore developer loves me and checks my patches, then tries to prevent nofee =)

Can I send you some tips?
